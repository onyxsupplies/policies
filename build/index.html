<p>Onyx Medical Supplies, Inc (&ldquo;Onyx&rdquo;) is committed to ensuring the confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information (ePHI) it receives, maintains, processes and/or transmits on behalf of its Customers. As providers of compliant, hosted infrastructure used by health technology vendors, developers, designers, agencies, custom development shops, and enterprises, Onyx strives to maintain compliance, proactively address information security, mitigate risk for its Customers, and assure known breaches are completely and effectively communicated in a timely manner. The following documents address core policies used by Onyx to maintain compliance and assure the proper protections of infrastructure used to store, process, and transmit ePHI for Onyx Customers.</p>

<p>Onyx provides secure and compliant cloud-based software. This hosted software falls into two broad categories: 1) <strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> and 2) <strong>Platform Add-ons</strong>. These Categories are cited throughout policies as Customers in each category inherit different policies, procedures, and obligations from Onyx.</p>

<h2 id="1-1-platform-as-a-service-paas">1.1 Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h2>

<p>PaaS Customers utilize hosted software and infrastructure from Onyx to deploy, host, and scale custom developed applications and configured databases. These customers are deployed into compliant containers run on systems secured and managed by Onyx. Onyx does not have insight or access into application level data of PaaS Customers and, as such, does not have the ability to secure or manage risk associated with application level vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. Onyx makes every effort to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure, access, and/or breach of PaaS Customer data through network (firewalls, dedicated IP spaces, etc) and server settings (encryption at rest and in transit, OSSEC throughout the Platform, etc).</p>

<h2 id="1-2-compliance-inheritance">1.2 Compliance Inheritance</h2>

<p>Onyx provides compliant hosted software infrastructure for its Customers. Onyx has been through a HIPAA compliance audit by a national third-party compliance firm to validate and map organizational policies and technical controls to HIPAA rules. Onyx&rsquo;s company policies, procedures, and technologies are HITRUST Certified. Onyx&rsquo;s service offerings are available on AWS, Azure, Rackspace, and SoftLayer; current production systems on these platforms are included in Onyx&rsquo;s third-party audits and HITRUST certification.</p>

<p>Onyx signs business associate agreements (BAAs) with its Customers. These BAAs outline Onyx obligations and Customer obligations, as well as liability in the case of a breach. In providing infrastructure and managing security configurations that are a part of the technology requirements that exist in HIPAA and HITRUST, as well as future compliance frameworks, Onyx manages various aspects of compliance for Customers. The aspects of compliance that Onyx manages for Customers are inherited by Customers, and Onyx assumes the risk associated with those aspects of compliance. In doing so, Onyx helps Customers achieve and maintain compliance, as well as mitigates Customers&rsquo; risk.</p>

<p>Onyx does not act as a covered entity. When Onyx does operate as a business associate (not a subcontractor), Onyx does not interface with users to obtain or provide access to ePHI. Access to ePHI is through our customers&rsquo; applications.</p>

<p>Certain aspects of compliance cannot be inherited. Because of this, Onyx Customers, in order to achieve full compliance or HITRUST Certification, must implement certain organizational policies. These policies and aspects of compliance fall outside of the services and obligations of Onyx.</p>

<p>Mappings of HIPAA Rules to Onyx controls and a mapping of what Rules are inherited by Customers, both Platform Customers and Add-on Customers, are covered in <a href="#2.-hipaa-inheritance">ยง2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1-3-onyx-organizational-concepts">1.3 Onyx Organizational Concepts</h2>

<p>The physical infrastructure environment is hosted at <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (AWS), <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Azure</a>, and <a href="http://www.softlayer.com/">IBM SoftLayer</a>. The network components and supporting network infrastructure are contained within the Rackspace, AWS, Azure, and SoftLayer infrastructures and managed by Rackspace, AWS, Microsoft, and IBM (respectively). Onyx does not have physical access into the network components. The Onyx environment consists of Cisco firewalls; nginx web servers; Java, Python, and Go application servers; Percona and PostgreSQL database servers; Logstash logging servers; Linux Ubuntu monitoring servers; Windows Server virtual machines; Chef and Salt configuration management servers; OSSEC IDS services; Docker containers; and developer tool servers running on Linux Ubuntu.</p>

<p>Within the Onyx Platform on Rackspace, AWS, Azure, and SoftLayer, all data transmission is encrypted and all hard drives are encrypted so data at rest is also encrypted; this applies to all servers - those hosting Docker containers, databases, APIs, log servers, etc. Onyx assumes all data <em>may</em> contain ePHI, even though our Risk Assessment does not indicate this is the case, and provides appropriate protections based on that assumption.</p>

<p>In the case of PaaS Customers, it is the responsibility of the Customer to restrict, secure, and assure the privacy of all ePHI data at the Application Level, as this is not under the control or purview of Onyx.</p>

<p>The data and network segmentation mechanism differs depending on the primitives offered by the underlying cloud provider infrastructure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Within Rackspace, hosted load balancers segment data and traffic while Cisco firewalls route traffic to private subnets for PaaS Customers and for Platform Add-ons.</li>
<li>Within AWS, hosted load balancers segment data across dedicated Virtual Private Clouds for PaaS Customers and for Platform Add-ons.</li>
<li>Within Azure, hosted load balancers segment data across dedicated Virtual Networks for PaaS Customers and for Platform Add-ons.</li>
<li>Within SoftLayer, hosted load balancers segment data across dedicated Private Networks for PaaS Customers and for Platform Add-ons.</li>
</ul>

<p>The segmentation strategies employed by Onyx effectively create RFC 1918, or dedicated, private segmented and separated networks and IP spaces, for each PaaS Customer and for Platform Add-ons.</p>

<p>Additionally, IPtables is used on each server for logical segmentation. IPtables is configured to restrict access to only justified ports and protocols. Onyx has implemented strict logical access controls so that only authorized personnel are given access to the internal management servers. The environment is configured so that data is transmitted from the load balancers to the application servers over a TLS encrypted session.</p>

<p>In the case of Platform Add-ons, once the data is received from the application server, a series of Application Programming Interface (API) calls is made to the database servers where the ePHI resides. The ePHI is separated into PostgreSQL and Percona databases through programming logic built so that access to one database server will not present you with the full ePHI spectrum.</p>

<p>The VPN server, nginx web server, and application servers are externally facing and accessible via the Internet. The database servers, where the ePHI resides, are located on the internal Onyx network and can only be accessed through a bastion host over a VPN connection. Access to the internal database is restricted to a limited number of personnel and strictly controlled to only those personnel with a business-justified reason. Remote access to internal servers is not accessible except through load balancers.</p>

<p>All Platform Add-ons and operating systems are tested end-to-end for usability, security, and impact prior to deployment to production.</p>

<h2 id="1-4-requesting-audit-and-compliance-reports">1.4 Requesting Audit and Compliance Reports</h2>

<p>Onyx, at its sole discretion, shares audit reports, including its HITRUST reports and Corrective Action Plans (CAPs), with customers on a case by case basis. All audit reports are shared under explicit NDA in Onyx format between Onyx and party to receive materials. Audit reports can be requested by Onyx workforce members for Customers or directly by Onyx Customers.</p>

<p>The following process is used to request audit reports:</p>

<ol>
<li>Email is sent to compliance-reports@onyx.supplies. In the email, please specify the type of report being requested and any required timelines for the report.</li>
<li>Onyx staff will log an issue with the details of the request into the Onyx Quality Management System. The Onyx Quality Management System is used to track requests&rsquo; status and outcomes.</li>
<li>Onyx will confirm if a current NDA is in place with the party requesting the audit report. If there is no NDA in place, Onyx will send one for execution.</li>
<li>Once it has been confirmed that an NDA is executed, Onyx staff will move the issue to &ldquo;Under Review&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The Onyx Security Officer or Privacy Officer must Approve or Reject the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, Onyx will notify the requesting party that we cannot share the requested report.</li>
<li>If the issue has been Approved, Onyx will send the customer the requested audit report and complete the Quality Management System issue for the request.</li>
</ol>

</ul>

<h2 id="3-2-maintenance-of-policies">3.2 Maintenance of Policies</h2>

<ol>
<li>All policies are stored and updated to maintain Onyx compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, NIST, and other relevant standards. Updates and version control are done similarly to source code control.</li>
<li>Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and Privacy Officer to assure they are accurate and up-to-date.</li>
<li>Onyx employees may request changes to policies using the following process:

<ol>
<li>The Onyx employee initiates a policy change request by creating an Issue in the Onyx Quality Management System. The change request may optionally include a GitHub pull request from a separate branch or repository containing the desired changes.</li>
<li>The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the policy change request.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</li>
<li>If the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using Onyx&rsquo;s <a href="#9.4-changing-existing-systems">change management process (ยง9.4)</a>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>All policies are made accessible to all Onyx workforce members. The current master policies are published at <a href="https://policy.onyx.supplies">https://policy.onyx.supplies</a>.

<ul>
<li>Changes are automatically communicated to all Onyx team members through integrations between GitHub and Slack that log all GitHub policy channels to a dedicated Onyx Slack Channel.</li>
<li>The Security Officer also communicates policy changes to all employees via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later

<ol>
<li>Version history of all Onyx policies is done via GitHub.</li>
<li>Backup storage of all policies is done with Box.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually, or after significant changes occur to Onyx&rsquo;s organizational environment. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by Onyx management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:

<ol>
<li>The Security Officer initiates the policy review by creating an Issue in the Onyx Quality Management System.</li>
<li>The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the current Onyx policies (<a href="https://policy.onyx.supplies/">https://policy.onyx.supplies/</a>).</li>
<li>If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are documented in the Issue.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</li>
<li>Policy review is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Onyx utilizes the HITRUST MyCSF framework to track compliance with the HITRUST CSF on an annual basis. Onyx also tracks compliance with HIPAA and publishes results at <a href="https://hipaa.onyx.supplies">https://hipaa.onyx.supplies</a>. In order to track and measure adherence on an annual basis, Onyx uses the following process to track HITRUST audits, both full and interim:

<ol>
<li>The Security Officer initiates the HITRUST audit activity by creating an Issue in the Onyx Quality Management System.</li>
<li>The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to own and manage the HITRUST activity.</li>
<li>Once the HITRUST activity is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</li>
<li>Compliance with annual compliance assessments, utilizing the HITRUST CSF as a framework, is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in <a href="#5.3-security-officer">ยง5.3.1</a>.</p>

						<h1 id="4-risk-management-policy">4. Risk Management Policy</h1>

<h2 id="4-3-risk-management-procedures">4.3 Risk Management Procedures</h2>

<h3 id="4-3-1-risk-assessment">4.3.1 Risk Assessment</h3>

<p>The intent of completing a risk assessment is to determine potential threats and vulnerabilities and the likelihood and impact should they occur. The output of this process helps to identify appropriate controls for reducing or eliminating risk.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step 1. System Characterization</p>

<ul>
<li>The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of the effort. To do this, identify where ePHI is received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. Using information-gathering techniques, the Onyx Platform boundaries are identified.</li>
<li>Output - Characterization of the Onyx Platform system assessed, a good picture of the Platform environment, and delineation of Platform boundaries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 2. Threat Identification</p>

<ul>
<li>Potential threats (the potential for threat-sources to successfully exercise a particular vulnerability) are identified and documented. All potential threat-sources from historical incidents and data from intelligence agencies, the government, etc., are reviewed to help generate a list of potential threats.</li>
<li>Output - A threat list containing a list of threat-sources that could exploit Platform vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 3. Vulnerability Identification</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a list of technical and non-technical Platform vulnerabilities that could be exploited or triggered by potential threat-sources. Vulnerabilities can range from incomplete or conflicting policies that govern an organization&rsquo;s computer usage to insufficient safeguards to protect facilities that house computer equipment to any number of software, hardware, or other deficiencies that comprise an organization&rsquo;s computer network.</li>
<li>Output - A list of the Platform vulnerabilities (observations) that could be exercised by potential threat-sources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 4. Control Analysis</p>

<ul>
<li>Document and assess the effectiveness of technical and non-technical controls that have been or will be implemented by Onyx to minimize or eliminate the likelihood / probability of a threat-source exploiting a Platform vulnerability.</li>
<li>Output - List of current or planned controls (policies, procedures, training, technical mechanisms, insurance, etc.) used for the Platform to mitigate the likelihood of a vulnerability being exercised and reduce the impact of such an adverse event.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 5. Likelihood Determination</p>

<ul>
<li>Determine the overall likelihood rating that indicates the probability that a vulnerability could be exploited by a threat-source given the existing or planned security controls.</li>
<li>Output - Likelihood rating of low (.1), medium (.5), or high (1). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 6. Impact Analysis</p>

<ul>
<li>Determine the level of adverse impact that would result from a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability. Factors of the data and systems to consider should include the importance to Onyx&rsquo;s mission; sensitivity and criticality (value or importance); costs associated; loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data.</li>
<li>Output - Magnitude of impact rating of low (10), medium (50), or high (100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 7. Risk Determination</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish a risk level. By multiplying the ratings from the likelihood determination and impact analysis, a risk level is determined. This represents the degree or level of risk to which an IT system, facility, or procedure might be exposed if a given vulnerability were exercised. The risk rating also presents actions that senior management must take for each risk level.</li>
<li>Output - Risk level of low (1-10), medium (&gt;10-50) or high (&gt;50-100). Refer to the NIST SP 800-30 definitions of low, medium, and high.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 8. Control Recommendations</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify controls that could reduce or eliminate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization&rsquo;s operations to an acceptable level. Factors to consider when developing controls may include effectiveness of recommended options (i.e., system compatibility), legislation and regulation, organizational policy, operational impact, and safety and reliability. Control recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the recommended procedural and technical security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.</li>
<li>Output - Recommendation of control(s) and alternative solutions to mitigate risk.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 9. Results Documentation</p>

<ul>
<li>Results of the risk assessment are documented in an official report, spreadsheet, or briefing and provided to senior management to make decisions on policy, procedure, budget, and Platform operational and management changes.</li>
<li>Output - A risk assessment report that describes the threats and vulnerabilities, measures the risk, and provides recommendations for control implementation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-3-2-risk-mitigation">4.3.2 Risk Mitigation</h3>

<p>Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Onyx Platform ePHI. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Step 1. Prioritize Actions</p>

<ul>
<li>Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources</li>
<li>Output - Actions ranked from high to low</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options</p>

<ul>
<li>Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a &ldquo;most appropriate&rdquo; control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.</li>
<li>Output - list of feasible controls</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis</p>

<ul>
<li>Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.</li>
<li>Output - Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 4. Select Control(s)</p>

<ul>
<li>Taking into account the information and results from previous steps, Onyx&rsquo;s mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.</li>
<li>Output - Selected control(s)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 5. Assign Responsibility</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training, and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.</li>
<li>Output - List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:</li>
<li>Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;</li>
<li>Prioritized actions;</li>
<li>The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;</li>
<li>Required resources for implementation of selected controls;</li>
<li>Team member responsible for implementation of each control;</li>
<li>Start date for implementation;</li>
<li>Target date for completion of implementation;</li>
<li>Maintenance requirements.</li>
<li>The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals&rsquo; time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Onyx Senior Management.</li>
<li>Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that assigned resources carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.</li>
<li>Output - Safeguard Implementation Plan</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Step 7. Implement Selected Controls</p>

<ul>
<li>As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.</li>
<li>Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.</li>
<li>Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes.</li>
<li>If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.</li>
<li>Output - Residual Risk documentation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-3-3-risk-management-schedule">4.3.3 Risk Management Schedule</h3>

<p>The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Onyx&rsquo;s information security program:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scheduled Basis - an overall risk assessment of Onyx&rsquo;s information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.</li>
<li>Throughout a System&rsquo;s Development Life Cycle - from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.</li>
<li>As Needed - the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Onyx&rsquo;s Platform.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-2-access-establishment-and-modification">7.2 Access Establishment and Modification</h2>

<ol>
<li>Requests for access to Onyx Platform systems and applications are made formally using the following process:

<ol>
<li>A Onyx workforce member initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the Onyx Quality Management System.

<ul>
<li>User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.</li>
<li>Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must be verified over the phone.</li>
<li>For new accounts, the method used to verify the user&rsquo;s identity must be recorded on the Issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Security Officer or Privacy Officer will grant access to systems as dictated by the employee&rsquo;s job title. If additional access is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a description of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required. The Security Officer or Privacy Officer then grants requested access.

<ul>
<li>New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that meets all requirements from <a href="#7.12-password-management">ยง7.12</a>, which must be changed on the initial login.</li>
<li>All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.</li>
<li>For production systems, access grants are accomplished by adding the appropriate user account to the corresponding LDAP group.</li>
<li>For non-production systems, access grants are accomplished by leveraging the access control mechanisms built into those systems. Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a Onyx employee at the discretion of the Security Officer or Privacy Officer .</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the Onyx Security Officer or Privacy Officer.</li>
<li>The request for access is retained for future reference.</li>
<li>All access to Onyx systems and services is reviewed and updated on a bi-annual basis to ensure proper authorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:

<ol>
<li>The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the Onyx Quality Management System.</li>
<li>The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each Onyx workforce member.</li>
<li>If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the process below is used to modify user access and notify the user of access changes. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</li>
<li>Review of user access is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Any Onyx workforce member can request change of access using the process outlined in <a href="#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification">ยง7.2 paragraph 1</a>.</li>
<li>Access to production systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication.</li>
<li>Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.

<ul>
<li>Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of Onyx Customers to define, and not Onyx.</li>
<li>Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks.

<ul>
<li>For production systems, this is enforced by creating non-privileged user accounts that must invoke <code>sudo</code> to perform privileged tasks.</li>
<li>Rights for privileged accounts are granted by the Security Officer or Privacy Officer using the process outlined in <a href="#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification">ยง7.2 paragraph 1</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.</li>
<li>Generic accounts are not allowed on Onyx systems.</li>
<li>Access is granted through encrypted, VPN tunnels that utilize two-factor authentication.

<ul>
<li>Two-factor authentication is accomplished using a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as the second factor.</li>
<li>VPN connections use 256-bit AES 256 encryption, or equivalent.</li>
<li>VPN sessions are automatically disconnected after 30 minutes of inactivity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access.</li>
<li>Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="7-3-workforce-clearance">7.3 Workforce Clearance</h2>

<ol>
<li>The level of security assigned to a user to the organization&rsquo;s information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user&rsquo;s job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.</li>
<li>All access requests are treated on a &ldquo;least-access principle.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Onyx maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data. As such, Onyx, including all workforce members, does not readily have access to any ePHI.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="7-4-access-authorization">7.4 Access Authorization</h2>

<ol>
<li>Role based access categories for each Onyx system and application are pre-approved by the Security Officer, or an authorized delegate of the Security Officer.</li>

<h2 id="8-2-auditing-policies">8.2 Auditing Policies</h2>

<ol>
<li>Responsibility for auditing information system access and activity is assigned to Onyx&rsquo;s Security Officer. The Security Officer shall:

<ul>
<li>Assign the task of generating reports for audit activities to the workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network;</li>
<li>Assign the task of reviewing the audit reports to the workforce member responsible for the application, system, or network, the Privacy Officer, or any other individual determined to be appropriate for the task;</li>
<li>Organize and provide oversight to a team structure charged with audit compliance activities (e.g., parameters, frequency, sample sizes, report formats, evaluation, follow-up, etc.).</li>
<li>All connections to Onyx are monitored. Access is limited to certain services, ports, and destinations. Exceptions to these rules, if created, are reviewed on an annual basis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Onyx&rsquo;s auditing processes shall address access and activity at the following levels listed below. In the case of PaaS Customers, Application and User level auditing is the responsibility of the Customer; Onyx provides software to aggregate and view User and Application logs, but the log data collected is the responsibility of the PaaS Customer. Auditing processes may address date and time of each log-on attempt, date and time of each log-off attempt, devices used, functions performed, etc.

<ul>
<li>User: User level audit trails generally monitor and log all commands directly initiated by the user, all identification and authentication attempts, and data and services accessed.</li>
<li>Application: Application level audit trails generally monitor and log all user activities, including data accessed and modified and specific actions.</li>
<li>System: System level audit trails generally monitor and log user activities, applications accessed, and other system defined specific actions. Onyx utilizes file system monitoring from OSSEC to assure the integrity of file system data.</li>
<li>Network: Network level audit trails generally monitor information on what is operating, penetrations, and vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Onyx shall log all incoming and outgoing traffic to into and out of its environment. This includes all successful and failed attempts at data access and editing. Data associated with this data will include origin, destination, time, and other relevant details that are available to Onyx.</li>
<li>Onyx utilizes OSSEC to scan all systems for malicious and unauthorized software every 2 hours and at reboot of systems.</li>
<li>Onyx leverages process monitoring tools throughout its environment.</li>
<li>Onyx treats its Dashboard as a Platform Add-on and, as such, it logs all activity associated with Dashboard Access.</li>
<li>Onyx uses OSSEC to monitor the integrity of log files by utilizing OSSEC System Integrity Checking capabilities.</li>
<li>Onyx shall identify &ldquo;trigger events&rdquo; or criteria that raise awareness of questionable conditions of viewing of confidential information. The &ldquo;events&rdquo; may be applied to the entire Onyx Platform or may be specific to a Customer, partner, business associate, Platform Add-on or application (See Listing of Potential Trigger Events below).</li>
<li>In addition to trigger events, Onyx utilizes OSSEC log correlation functionality to proactively identify and enable alerts based on log data.</li>
<li>Logs are reviewed weekly by the Security Officer.</li>
<li>Onyx&rsquo;s Security Officer and Privacy Officer are authorized to select and use auditing tools that are designed to detect network vulnerabilities and intrusions. Such tools are explicitly prohibited by others, including Customers and Partners, without the explicit authorization of the Security Officer. These tools may include, but are not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Scanning tools and devices;</li>
<li>Password cracking utilities;</li>
<li>Network &ldquo;sniffers.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Passive and active intrusion detection systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The process for review of audit logs, trails, and reports shall include:

<ul>
<li>Description of the activity as well as rationale for performing the audit.</li>
<li>Identification of which Onyx workforce members will be responsible for review (workforce members shall not review audit logs that pertain to their own system activity).</li>
<li>Frequency of the auditing process.</li>
<li>Determination of significant events requiring further review and follow-up.</li>
<li>Identification of appropriate reporting channels for audit results and required follow-up.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vulnerability testing software may be used to probe the network to identify what is running (e.g., operating system or product versions in place), whether publicly-known vulnerabilities have been corrected, and evaluate whether the system can withstand attacks aimed at circumventing security controls.

<ul>
<li>Testing may be carried out internally or provided through an external third-party vendor. Whenever possible, a third party auditing vendor should not be providing the organization IT oversight services (e.g., vendors providing IT services should not be auditing their own services - separation of duties).</li>
<li>Testing shall be done on a routine basis, currently monthly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Software patches and updates will be applied to all systems in a timely manner.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="8-3-audit-requests">8.3 Audit Requests</h2>

<ol>
<li>A request may be made for an audit for a specific cause. The request may come from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, Privacy Officer, Security Officer, Customer, Partner, or an Application owner or application user.</li>
<li>A request for an audit for specific cause must include time frame, frequency, and nature of the request. The request must be reviewed and approved by Onyx&rsquo;s Privacy or Security Officer.</li>
<li>A request for an audit must be approved by Onyx&rsquo;s Privacy Officer and/or Security Officer before proceeding. Under no circumstances shall detailed audit information be shared with parties without proper permissions and access to see such data.

<ul>
<li>Should the audit disclose that a workforce member has accessed ePHI inappropriately, the minimum necessary/least privileged information shall be shared with Onyx&rsquo;s Security Officer to determine appropriate sanction/corrective disciplinary action.</li>
<li>Only de-identified information shall be shared with Customer or Partner regarding the results of the investigative audit process. This information will be communicated to the appropriate personnel by Onyx&rsquo;s Privacy Officer or designee. Prior to communicating with customers and partners regarding an audit, it is recommended that Onyx consider seeking risk management and/or legal counsel.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="8-4-review-and-reporting-of-audit-findings">8.4 Review and Reporting of Audit Findings</h2>

<ol>
<li>Audit information that is routinely gathered must be reviewed in a timely manner, currently monthly, by the responsible workforce member(s). On a quarterly basis, logs are reviewed to assure the proper data is being captured and retained. The following process details how log reviews are done at Onyx:

<ol>
<li>The Security Officer initiates the log review by creating an Issue in the Onyx Quality Management System.</li>
<li>The Security Officer, or a Onyx Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to review the logs.</li>
<li>Relevant audit log findings are added to the Issue; these findings are investigated in a later step. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. Relevant findings are reviewed at this stage. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation. The communications protocol around specific findings are outlined below.</li>
<li>If the Issue is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The reporting process shall allow for meaningful communication of the audit findings to those workforce members, Customers, or Partners requesting the audit.

<ul>
<li>Significant findings shall be reported immediately in a written format. Onyx&rsquo;s security incident response form may be utilized to report a single event.</li>
<li>Routine findings shall be reported to the sponsoring leadership structure in a written report format.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reports of audit results shall be limited to internal use on a minimum necessary/need-to-know basis. Audit results shall not be disclosed externally without administrative and/or legal counsel approval.</li>
<li>Security audits constitute an internal, confidential monitoring practice that may be included in Onyx&rsquo;s performance improvement activities and reporting. Care shall be taken to ensure that the results of the audits are disclosed to administrative level oversight structures only and that information which may further expose organizational risk is shared with extreme caution. Generic security audit information may be included in organizational reports (individually-identifiable ePHI shall not be included in the reports).</li>
<li>Whenever indicated through evaluation and reporting, appropriate corrective actions must be undertaken. These actions shall be documented and shared with the responsible workforce members, Customers, and/or Partners.</li>
<li>Log review activity is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="8-5-auditing-customer-and-partner-activity">8.5 Auditing Customer and Partner Activity</h2>

<ol>
<li>Periodic monitoring of Customer and Partner activity shall be carried out to ensure that access and activity is appropriate for privileges granted and necessary to the arrangement between Onyx and the 3rd party. Onyx will make every effort to assure Customers and Partners do not gain access to data outside of their own Environments.</li>
<li>If it is determined that the Customer or Partner has exceeded the scope of access privileges, Onyx&rsquo;s leadership must remedy the problem immediately.</li>
<li>If it is determined that a Customer or Partner has violated the terms of the HIPAA business associate agreement or any terms within the HIPAA regulations, Onyx must take immediate action to remediate the situation. Continued violations may result in discontinuation of the business relationship.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="8-6-audit-log-security-controls-and-backup">8.6 Audit Log Security Controls and Backup</h2>

<ol>
<li>Audit logs shall be protected from unauthorized access or modification, so the information they contain will be made available only if needed to evaluate a security incident or for routine audit activities as outlined in this policy.</li>
<li>All audit logs are protected in transit and encrypted at rest to control access to the content of the logs.</li>
<li>Audit logs shall be stored on a separate system to minimize the impact auditing may have on the privacy system and to prevent access to audit trails by those with system administrator privileges.

<ul>
<li>Separate systems are used to apply the security principle of &ldquo;separation of duties&rdquo; to protect audit trails from hackers.</li>
<li>Onyx logging servers include Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) as part of their baseline configuration to ease reviewing of audit log data. The ELK toolkit provides message summarization, reduction, and reporting functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For PaaS Customers choosing to use Onyx logging services, log data will be separated from the log data of other Onyx Customers.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="8-7-workforce-training-education-awareness-and-responsibilities">8.7 Workforce Training, Education, Awareness and Responsibilities</h2>

<ol>

<h2 id="9-2-configuration-management-policies">9.2 Configuration Management Policies</h2>

<ol>
<li>Chef and Salt are used to standardize and automate configuration management.</li>
<li>No systems are deployed into Onyx environments without approval of the Onyx CTO.</li>
<li>All changes to production systems, network devices, and firewalls are approved by the Onyx CTO before they are implemented to assure they comply with business and security requirements.</li>
<li>All changes to production systems are tested before they are implemented in production.</li>
<li>Implementation of approved changes are only performed by authorized personnel.</li>
<li>Tooling to generate an up-to-date inventory of systems, including corresponding architecture diagrams for related products and services, is hosted on GitLab.

<ul>
<li>All systems are categorized as production and utility to differentiate based on criticality.</li>
<li>The Security Officer maintains scripts to generate inventory lists on demand using APIs provided by each cloud provider.</li>
<li>These scripts are used to generate the diagrams and asset lists required by the Risk Assessment phase of Onyx&rsquo;s Risk Management procedures (<a href="#4.3-risk-management-procedures">ยง4.3.1</a>).</li>
<li>After every use of these scripts, the Security Officer will verify their accuracy by reconciling their output with recent changes to production systems. The Security Officer will address any discrepancies immediately with changes to the scripts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All frontend functionality (developer dashboards and portals) is separated from backend (database and app servers) systems by being deployed on separate servers or containers.</li>
<li>All software and systems are tested using unit tests and end to end tests.</li>
<li>All committed code is reviewed using pull requests to assure software code quality and proactively detect potential security issues in development.</li>
<li>Onyx utilizes development and staging environments that mirror production to assure proper function.</li>
<li>Onyx also deploys environments locally using Vagrant to assure functionality before moving to staging or production.</li>
<li>All formal change requests require unique ID and authentication.</li>
<li>Onyx uses the <a href="http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/">Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs)</a> published by the Defense Information Systems Agency as a baseline for hardening systems.

<ul>
<li>Windows-based systems use a baseline Active Directory group policy configuration in conjunction with the Windows Server 2012 STIG.</li>
<li>Linux-based systems use a Red Hat Enterprise Linux STIG which has been adapted for Ubuntu and improved based on the results of subsequent vulnerability scans and risk assessments.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clocks are continuously synchronized to an authoritative source across all systems using NTP or a platform-specific equivalent. Modifying time data on systems is restricted.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="9-3-provisioning-production-systems">9.3 Provisioning Production Systems</h2>

<ol>
<li>Before provisioning any systems, ops team members must file a request in the Onyx Quality Management System.

<ul>
<li>Quality Management System access requires authenticated users.</li>
<li>The CTO grants access to the Quality Management System following the procedures covered in the <a href="#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification">Access Establishment and Modification section</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The CTO, or an authorized delegate of the CTO, must approve the provisioning request before any new system can be provisioned.</li>
<li>Once provisioning has been approved, the ops team member must configure the new system according to the standard baseline chosen for the system&rsquo;s role.

<ul>
<li>For Linux systems, this means adding the appropriate grains to the Salt configuration file and running a <code>highstate</code> operation.</li>
<li>For Windows systems, this means adding the appropriate roles to the system&rsquo;s Chef profile and forcing a Chef run.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the system will be used to house production data (ePHI), the ops team member must add an encrypted block data volume to the VM during provisioning.

<ul>
<li>For systems on AWS, the ops team member must add an encrypted Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume.</li>
<li>For systems on other cloud providers, the ops team member must add a block data volume and set up OS-level data encryption using Salt or Chef.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once the system has been provisioned, the ops team member must contact the security team to inspect the new system. A member of the security team will verify that the secure baseline has been applied to the new system, including (but not limited to) verifying the following items:

<ul>
<li>Removal of default users used during provisioning.</li>
<li>Network configuration for system.</li>
<li>Data volume encryption settings.</li>
<li>Intrusion detection and virus scanning software installed.</li>
<li>All items listed below in the operating system-specific subsections below.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once the security team member has verified the new system is correctly configured, the team member must add that system to the Nessus security scanner configuration.</li>
<li>The new system may be rotated into production once the CTO verifies all the provisioning steps listed above have been correctly followed and has marked the Issue with the <code>Approved</code> state.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="9-3-1-provisioning-linux-systems">9.3.1 Provisioning Linux Systems</h3>

<ol>
<li>Linux systems have their baseline security configuration applied via Salt states. These baseline Salt states cover:

<ul>
<li>Ensuring that the machine is up-to-date with security patches and is configured to apply patches in accordance with our policies.</li>
<li>Stopping and disabling any unnecessary OS services.</li>
<li>Installing and configuring the OSSEC IDS agent.</li>
<li>Configuring 15-minute session inactivity timeouts.</li>
<li>Installing and configuring the ClamAV virus scanner.</li>
<li>Installing and configuring the NTP daemon, including ensuring that modifying system time cannot be performed by unprivileged users.</li>
<li>Configuring LUKS volumes for providers that do not have native support for encrypted data volumes, including ensuring that encryption keys are protected from unauthorized access.</li>
<li>Configuring authentication to the centralized LDAP servers.</li>
<li>Configuring audit logging as described in the <a href="#8.-auditing-policy">Auditing Policy section</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Any additional Salt states applied to the Linux system must be clearly documented by the ops team member in the DT request by specifying the purpose of the new system.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="9-3-2-provisioning-windows-systems">9.3.2 Provisioning Windows Systems</h3>

<ol>
<li>Windows systems have their baseline security configuration applied via the combination of Group Policy settings and Chef recipes. These baseline settings cover:

<ul>
<li>Joining the Windows Domain Controller and applying the Active Directory Group Policy configuration.</li>
<li>Ensuring that the machine is up-to-date with security patches and is configured to apply patches in accordance with our policies.</li>
<li>Stopping and disabling any unnecessary OS services.</li>
<li>Installing and configuring the OSSEC IDS agent.</li>
<li>Configuring 15-minute session inactivity timeouts.</li>
<li>Installing and configuring the Avast virus scanner.</li>
<li>Configuring transport encryption according to the requirements described in <a href="#17.9-transmission-security">ยง17.9</a>.</li>
<li>Configuring the system clock, including ensuring that modifying system time cannot be performed by unprivileged users.</li>
<li>Configuring audit logging as described in the <a href="#8.-auditing-policy">Auditing Policy section</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Any additional Salt states applied to the Linux system must be clearly documented by the ops team member in the DT request by specifying the purpose of the new system.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="9-3-3-provisioning-management-systems">9.3.3 Provisioning Management Systems</h3>

<ol>
<li>Provisioning management systems such as Salt servers, LDAP servers, or VPN appliances follows the same procedure as provisioning a production system.</li>
<li>Provisioning the first Salt server for a production pod requires bootstrapping Salt. An authorized member of the Dev Ops team will oversee provisioning a new Salt server.

<ul>
<li>Once the Salt server has been bootstrapped, the ops team member will apply the baseline configuration to the Salt server by performing a <code>highstate</code> operation as usual.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Critical infrastructure services such as logging, monitoring, LDAP servers, or Windows Domain Controllers must be configured with appropriate Salt states.

<ul>
<li>These Salt states have been approved by the CTO, or an authorized delegate of the CTO, to be in accordance with all Onyx policies, including setting appropriate:

<ul>
<li>Audit logging requirements.</li>
<li>Password size, strength, and expiration requirements.</li>
<li>Transmission encryption requirements.</li>
<li>Network connectivity timeouts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Critical infrastruture roles applied to new systems must be clearly documented by the ops team member in the DT request.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="9-4-changing-existing-systems">9.4 Changing Existing Systems</h2>

<ol>
<li>Subsequent changes to already-provisioned systems are unconditionally handled by one of the following methods:

<ul>
<li>Changes to Salt states or pillar values.</li>
<li>Changes to Chef recipes.</li>
<li>For configuration changes that cannot be handled by Chef or Salt, a runbook describing exactly what changes will be made and by whom.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Configuration changes to Chef recipes or Salt states must be initiated by creating a Merge Request in GitLab.

<ul>
<li>The ops team member will create a feature branch and make their changes on that branch.</li>
<li>The ops team member must test their configuration change locally when possible, or on a development and/or staging sandbox otherwise.</li>
<li>At least one other ops team member must review the Chef or Salt change before merging the change into the main branch.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In all cases, before rolling out the change to production, the ops team member must file an Issue in the DT project describing the change. This Issue must link to the reviewed Merge Request and/or include a link to the runbook.</li>
<li>Once the request has been approved by the CTO, the ops team member may roll out the change into production environments.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="9-5-patch-management-procedures">9.5 Patch Management Procedures</h2>

<ol>
<li>Onyx uses automated tooling to ensure systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li>
<li>On Ubuntu Linux systems, the unattended-upgrades tool is used to apply security patches in phases.

<ul>
<li>The security team maintains a mirrored snapshot of security patches from the upstream OS vendor. This mirror is synchronized bi-weekly and applied to development systems nightly.</li>
<li>If the development systems function properly after the two-week testing period, the security team will promote that snapshot into the mirror used by all staging systems. These patches will be applied to all staging systems during the next nightly patch run.</li>
<li>If the staging systems function properly after the two-week testing period, the security team will promote that snapshot into the mirror used by all production systems. These patches will be applied to all production systems during the next nightly patch run.</li>
<li>Patches for critical kernel security vulnerabilities may be applied to production systems using hot-patching tools at the discretion of the Security Officer. These patches must follow the same phased testing process used for non-kernel security patches; this process may be expedited for severe vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On Windows systems, the baseline Group Policy setting configures Windows Update to implement the patching policy.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="9-6-software-development-procedures">9.6 Software Development Procedures</h2>

<ol>
<li>All development uses feature branches based on the main branch used for the current release. Any changes required for a new feature or defect fix are committed to that feature branch.

<ul>
<li>These changes must be covered under 1) a unit test where possible, or 2) integration tests.</li>
<li>Integration tests are <em>required</em> if unit tests cannot reliably exercise all facets of the change.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Developers are strongly encouraged to follow the <a href="https://github.com/blog/926-shiny-new-commit-styles">commit message conventions suggested by GitHub</a>.

<ul>
<li>Commit messages should be wrapped to 72 characters.</li>
<li>Commit messages should be written in the present tense. This convention matches up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once the feature and corresponding tests are complete, a pull request will be created using the GitHub/GitLab web interface. The pull request should indicate which feature or defect is being addressed and should provide a high-level description of the changes made.</li>
<li>Code reviews are performed as part of the pull request procedure. Once a change is ready for review, the author(s) will notify other engineers using an appropriate mechanism, typically via an <code>@channel</code> message in Slack.

<ul>
<li>Other engineers will review the changes, using the guidelines above.</li>
<li>Engineers should note all potential issues with the code; it is the responsibility of the author(s) to address those issues or explain why they are not applicable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the feature or defect interacts with ePHI, or controls access to data potentially containing ePHI, the code changes must be reviewed by two members of Onyx&rsquo;s Blue Team (software security team) before the feature is marked as complete.

<ul>
<li>The Blue Team members will provide a security analysis of features to ensure they satisfy Onyx&rsquo;s compliance and security commitments.</li>
<li>This review must include a security analysis for potential vulnerabilities such as those listed in the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10">OWASP Top 10</a> or the <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/">CWE top 25</a>.</li>
<li>This review must also verify that any actions performed by authenticated users will generate appropriate audit log entries.</li>
<li>Blue Team members are required to undergo annual training on identifying the most common software vulnerabilities and will receive ongoing training on Onyx&rsquo;s compliance and security requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once the review process finishes, each reviewer should leave a comment on the pull request saying &ldquo;looks good to me&rdquo; (often abbreviated as &ldquo;LGTM&rdquo;), at which point the original author(s) may merge their change into the release branch.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="9-7-software-release-procedures">9.7 Software Release Procedures</h2>

<ol>
<li>Software releases are treated as changes to existing systems and thus follow the procedure described in <a href="#9.4-changing-existing-systems">ยง9.4</a>.</li>
</ol>

						<h1 id="10-facility-access-policy">10. Facility Access Policy</h1>

<h2 id="11-2-incident-management-policies">11.2 Incident Management Policies</h2>

<p>The Onyx incident response process follows the process recommended by <a href="https://www.sans.org">SANS</a>, an industry leader in security. Process flows are a direct representation of the SANS process which can be found in <a href="/sections/incident-flowchart.pdf">this document</a>.</p>

<p>Onyx&rsquo;s incident response classifies security-related events into the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Events</strong> - Any observable computer security-related occurrence in a system or network with a negative consequence. Examples:

<ul>
<li>Hardware component failing causing service outages.</li>
<li>Software error causing service outages.</li>
<li>General network or system instability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Precursors</strong> - A sign that an incident may occur in the future. Examples:

<ul>
<li>Monitoring system showing unusual behavior.</li>
<li>Audit log alerts indicated several failed login attempts.</li>
<li>Suspicious emails targeting specific Onyx staff members with administrative access to production systems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Indications</strong> - A sign that an incident may have occurred or may be occurring at the present time. Examples:

<ul>
<li>IDS alerts for modified system files or unusual system accesses.</li>
<li>Antivirus alerts for infected files.</li>
<li>Excessive network traffic directed at unexpected geographic locations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Incidents</strong> - A violation of computer security policies or acceptable use policies, often resulting in data breaches. Examples:

<ul>
<li>Unauthorized disclosure of ePHI.</li>
<li>Unauthorized change or destruction of ePHI.</li>
<li>A data breach accomplished by an internal or external entity.</li>
<li>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack causing a critical service to become unreachable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Onyx employees must report any unauthorized or suspicious activity seen on production systems or associated with related communication systems (such as email or Slack). In practice this means keeping an eye out for security events, and letting the Security Officer know about any observed precursors or indications as soon as they are discovered.</p>

<h3 id="11-2-1-identification-phase">11.2.1 Identification Phase</h3>

<ol>
<li>Immediately upon observation Onyx members report suspected and known Events, Precursors, Indications, and Incidents in one of the following ways:

<ol>
<li>Direct report to management, the Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or other;</li>
<li>Email;</li>
<li>Phone call;</li>
<li>Online incident response form located <a href="google_form_url_here">here</a>;</li>
<li>Secure Chat;</li>
<li>Anonymously through workforce member&rsquo;s desired channels.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The individual receiving the report facilitates completion of an <a href="/sections/IH-Identification.pdf">Incident Identification form</a> and notifies the Security Officer (if not already done).</li>
<li>The Security Officer determines if the issue is an Event, Precursor, Indication, or Incident.

<ol>
<li>If the issue is an event, indication, or precursor the Security Officer forwards it to the appropriate resource for resolution.

<ol>
<li>Non-Technical Event (minor infringement): the Security Officer completes a <a href="/sections/sir-form.doc">SIR Form</a> and investigates the incident.</li>
<li>Technical Event: Assign the issue to an IT resource for resolution. This resource may also be a contractor or outsourced technical resource, in the event of a small office or lack of expertise in the area.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If the issue is a security incident the Security Officer activates the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) and notifies senior management.

<ol>
<li>If a non-technical security incident is discovered the SIRT completes the investigation, implements preventative measures, and resolves the security incident.</li>
<li>Once the investigation is completed, progress to Phase V, Follow-up.</li>
<li>If the issue is a technical security incident, commence to Phase II: Containment.</li>
<li>The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Phases are highly technical. It is important to have them completed by a highly qualified technical security resource with oversight by the SIRT team.</li>
<li>Each individual on the SIRT and the technical security resource document all measures taken during each phase, including the start and end times of all efforts.</li>
<li>The lead member of the SIRT team facilitates initiation of a <a href="/sections/sir-form.doc">SIR Form</a> or an <a href="/sections/IH-Survey.pdf">Incident Survey Form</a>. The intent of the SIR form is to provide a summary of all events, efforts, and conclusions of each Phase of this policy and procedures.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Security Officer, Privacy Officer, or Onyx representative appointed notifies any affected Customers and Partners. If no Customers and Partners are affected, notification is at the discretion of the Security and Privacy Officer.</li>
<li>In the case of a threat identified, the Security Officer is to form a team to investigate and involve necessary resources, both internal to Onyx and potentially external.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="11-2-2-containment-phase-technical">11.2.2 Containment Phase (Technical)</h3>

<p>In this Phase, Onyx&rsquo;s IT department attempts to contain the security incident. It is extremely important to take detailed notes during the security incident response process. This provides that the evidence gathered during the security incident can be used successfully during prosecution, if appropriate.</p>

<ol>
<li>The SIRT reviews any information that has been collected by the Security Officer or any other individual investigating the security incident.</li>
<li>The SIRT secures the network perimeter.</li>
<li>The IT department performs the following:

<ol>
<li>Securely connect to the affected system over a trusted connection.</li>
<li>Retrieve any volatile data from the affected system.</li>
<li>Determine the relative integrity and the appropriateness of backing the system up.</li>
<li>If appropriate, back up the system.</li>
<li>Change the password(s) to the affected system(s).</li>
<li>Determine whether it is safe to continue operations with the affected system(s).</li>
<li>If it is safe, allow the system to continue to function;

<ol>
<li>Complete any documentation relative to the security incident on the <a href="/sections/sir-form.doc">SIR Form</a>.</li>
<li>Move to Phase V, Follow-up.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If it is NOT safe to allow the system to continue operations, discontinue the system(s) operation and move to Phase III, Eradication.</li>
<li>The individual completing this phase provides written communication to the SIRT.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Continuously apprise Senior Management of progress.</li>
<li>Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="11-2-3-eradication-phase-technical">11.2.3 Eradication Phase (Technical)</h3>

<p>The Eradication Phase represents the SIRT&rsquo;s effort to remove the cause, and the resulting security exposures, that are now on the affected system(s).</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine symptoms and cause related to the affected system(s).</li>
<li>Strengthen the defenses surrounding the affected system(s), where possible (a risk assessment may be needed and can be determined by the Security Officer). This may include the following:

<ol>
<li>An increase in network perimeter defenses.</li>
<li>An increase in system monitoring defenses.</li>
<li>Remediation (&ldquo;fixing&rdquo;) any security issues within the affected system, such as removing unused services/general host hardening techniques.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Conduct a detailed vulnerability assessment to verify all the holes/gaps that can be exploited have been addressed.

<ol>
<li>If additional issues or symptoms are identified, take appropriate preventative measures to eliminate or minimize potential future compromises.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Complete the <a href="/sections/IH-Eradication.pdf">Eradication Form</a>.</li>
<li>Update the documentation with the information learned from the vulnerability assessment, including the cause, symptoms, and the method used to fix the problem with the affected system(s).</li>
<li>Apprise Senior Management of the progress.</li>
<li>Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed.</li>
<li>Move to Phase IV, Recovery.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="11-2-4-recovery-phase-technical">11.2.4 Recovery Phase (Technical)</h3>

<p>The Recovery Phase represents the SIRT&rsquo;s effort to restore the affected system(s) back to operation after the resulting security exposures, if any, have been corrected.</p>

<ol>
<li>The technical team determines if the affected system(s) have been changed in any way.

<ol>
<li>If they have, the technical team restores the system to its proper, intended functioning (&ldquo;last known good&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Once restored, the team validates that the system functions the way it was intended/had functioned in the past. This may require the involvement of the business unit that owns the affected system(s).</li>
<li>If operation of the system(s) had been interrupted (i.e., the system(s) had been taken offline or dropped from the network while triaged), restart the restored and validated system(s) and monitor for behavior.</li>
<li>If the system had not been changed in any way, but was taken offline (i.e., operations had been interrupted), restart the system and monitor for proper behavior.</li>
<li>Update the documentation with the detail that was determined during this phase.</li>
<li>Apprise Senior Management of progress.</li>
<li>Continue to notify affected Customers and Partners with relevant updates as needed.</li>
<li>Move to Phase V, Follow-up.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="11-2-5-follow-up-phase-technical-and-non-technical">11.2.5 Follow-up Phase (Technical and Non-Technical)</h3>

<p>The Follow-up Phase represents the review of the security incident to look for &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; and to determine whether the process that was taken could have been improved in any way. It is recommended all security incidents be reviewed shortly after resolution to determine where response could be improved. Timeframes may extend to one to two weeks post-incident.</p>

<ol>
<li>Responders to the security incident (SIRT Team and technical security resource) meet to review the documentation collected during the security incident.</li>
<li>Create a &ldquo;lessons learned&rdquo; document and attach it to the completed <a href="/sections/sir-form.doc">SIR Form</a>.

<ol>
<li>Evaluate the cost and impact of the security incident to Onyx using the documents provided by the SIRT and the technical security resource.</li>
<li>Determine what could be improved.</li>
<li>Communicate these findings to Senior Management for approval and for implementation of any recommendations made post-review of the security incident.</li>
<li>Carry out recommendations approved by Senior Management; sufficient budget, time and resources should be committed to this activity.</li>
<li>Close the security incident.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="11-2-6-periodic-evaluation">11.2.6 Periodic Evaluation</h3>

<p>It is important to note that the processes surrounding security incident response should be periodically reviewed and evaluated for effectiveness. This also involves appropriate training of resources expected to respond to security incidents, as well as the training of the general population regarding Onyx&rsquo;s expectation for them, relative to security responsibilities.

						<h1 id="12-breach-policy">12. Breach Policy</h1>

<p>To provide guidance for breach notification when impressive or unauthorized access, acquisition, use and/or disclosure of the ePHI occurs. Breach notification will be carried out in compliance with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) as well as any other federal or state notification law.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has published breach notification rules for vendors of personal health records as required by ARRA/HITECH. The FTC rule applies to entities not covered by HIPAA, primarily vendors of personal health records. The rule is effective September 24, 2009 with full compliance required by February 22, 2010.</p>

<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009. Title XIII of ARRA is the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). HITECH significantly impacts the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules. While HIPAA did not require notification when patient protected health information (PHI) was inappropriately disclosed, covered entities and business associates may have chosen to include notification as part of the mitigation process. HITECH does require notification of certain breaches of unsecured PHI to the following: individuals, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the media. The effective implementation for this provision is September 23, 2009 (pending publication HHS regulations).</p>

<p>In the case of a breach, Onyx shall notify all affected Customers. It is the responsibility of the Customers to notify affected individuals.</p>

<h2 id="12-2-onyx-breach-policy">12.2 Onyx Breach Policy</h2>

<ol>
<li>Discovery of Breach: A breach of ePHI shall be treated as &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; as of the first day on which such breach is known to the organization, or, by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known to Onyx (includes breaches by the organization&rsquo;s Customers, Partners, or subcontractors). Onyx shall be deemed to have knowledge of a breach if such breach is known or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person, other than the person committing the breach, who is a workforce member or Partner of the organization. Following the discovery of a potential breach, the organization shall begin an investigation (see organizational policies for security incident response and/or risk management incident response) immediately, conduct a risk assessment, and based on the results of the risk assessment, begin the process to notify each Customer affected by the breach. Onyx shall also begin the process of determining what external notifications are required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.)</li>
<li>Breach Investigation: The Onyx Security Officer shall name an individual to act as the investigator of the breach (e.g., privacy officer, security officer, risk manager, etc.). The investigator shall be responsible for the management of the breach investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate (e.g., administration, security incident response team, human resources, risk management, public relations, legal counsel, etc.) The investigator shall be the key facilitator for all breach notification processes to the appropriate entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.). All documentation related to the breach investigation, including the risk assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of six years. A template breach log is located <a href="/sections/breach.log.pdf">here</a>.</li>
<li>Risk Assessment: For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of ePHI to constitute a breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A use or disclosure of ePHI that is incident to an otherwise permissible use or disclosure and occurs despite reasonable safeguards and proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy Rule and would not qualify as a potential breach. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of ePHI constitutes a breach and requires further notification, the organization will need to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is significant risk of harm to the individual as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. The organization shall document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in the incident report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. The organization has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications to appropriate Customers or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, the organization will determine the need to move forward with breach notification. The risk assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and address:

<ul>
<li>Consideration of who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;</li>
<li>The type and amount of ePHI involved;</li>
<li>The cause of the breach, and the entity responsible for the breach, either Customer, Onyx, or Partner;</li>
<li>The potential for significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Timeliness of Notification: Upon discovery of a breach, notice shall be made to the affected Onyx Customers no later than 4 hours after the discovery of the breach. It is the responsibility of the organization to demonstrate that all notifications were made as required, including evidence demonstrating the necessity of delay.</li>
<li>Delay of Notification Authorized for Law Enforcement Purposes:  If a law enforcement official states to the organization that a notification, notice, or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, the organization shall:

<ul>
<li>If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the timer period specified by the official; or</li>
<li>If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the identify of the official making the statement, and delay the notification, notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is submitted during that time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Content of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must contain the following information:

<ul>
<li>A brief description of what happened, including the date of the breach and the date of the discovery of the breach, if known;</li>
<li>A description of the types of unsecured protected health information that were involved in the breach (such as whether full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code or other types of information were involved), if known;</li>
<li>Any steps the Customer should take to protect Customer data from potential harm resulting from the breach;</li>
<li>A brief description of what Onyx is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and Customers, and to protect against further breaches;</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Methods of Notification: Onyx Customers will be notified via email and phone within the timeframe for reporting breaches, as outlined above.</li>
<li>Maintenance of Breach Information/Log: As described above and in addition to the reports created for each incident, Onyx shall maintain a process to record or log all breaches of unsecured ePHI regardless of the number of records and Customers affected. The following information should be collected/logged for each breach (see sample Breach Notification Log):

<ul>
<li>A description of what happened, including the date of the breach, the date of the discovery of the breach, and the number of records and Customers affected, if known.</li>

						<h1 id="13-disaster-recovery-policy">13. Disaster Recovery Policy</h1>

<p>The Onyx Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover Onyx following a disruption resulting from a disaster. This Disaster Recovery Policy is maintained by the Onyx Security Officer and Privacy Officer.</p>

<p>The following objectives have been established for this plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan that consists of the following phases:

<ul>
<li><em>Notification/Activation phase</em> to detect and assess damage and to activate the plan;</li>
<li><em>Recovery phase</em> to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage done to the original system;</li>
<li><em>Reconstitution phase</em> to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal operations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out Onyx processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal operations.</li>
<li>Identify and define the impact of interruptions to Onyx systems.</li>
<li>Assign responsibilities to designated personnel and provide guidance for recovering Onyx systems during prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations.</li>
<li>Ensure coordination with other Onyx staff who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.</li>
<li>Ensure coordination with external points of contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.</li>
</ol>

<p>This Onyx Contingency Plan has been developed as required under the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Final Security Rule, Section ยง164.308(a)(7), which requires the establishment and implementation of procedures for responding to events that damage systems containing electronic protected health information.</p>

<p>This Onyx Contingency Plan is created under the legislative requirements set forth in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and the guidelines established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-34, titled &ldquo;Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems&rdquo; dated June 2002.</p>

<p>The Onyx Contingency Plan also complies with the following federal and departmental policies:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Computer Security Act of 1987;</li>
<li>OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix III, November 2000;</li>
<li>Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65, Federal Executive Branch Continuity of Operations, July 1999;</li>
<li>Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 67, Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations, October 1998;</li>
<li>PDD 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, May 1998;</li>
<li>Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), The Federal Response Plan (FRP), April 1999;</li>
<li>Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), Title X, Subtitle G, &ldquo;Government Information Security Reform,&rdquo; October 30, 2000</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of the types of disasters that would initiate this plan are natural disaster, political disturbances, man made disaster, external human threats, internal malicious activities.</p>

<p>Onyx defines two categories of systems from a disaster recovery perspective.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Critical Systems</em>. These systems host application servers and database servers or are required for functioning of systems that host application servers and database servers. These systems, if unavailable, affect the integrity of data and must be restored, or have a process begun to restore them, immediately upon becoming unavailable.</li>
<li><em>Non-critical Systems</em>. These are all systems not considered critical by definition above. These systems, while they may affect the performance and overall security of critical systems, do not prevent Critical systems from functioning and being accessed appropriately. These systems are restored at a lower priority than critical systems.</li>

<h2 id="14-2-disposable-media-policy">14.2 Disposable Media Policy</h2>

<ol>
<li>All removable media is restricted, audited, and is encrypted.</li>
<li>Onyx assumes all disposable media in its Platform may contain ePHI, so it treats all disposable media with the same protections and disposal policies.</li>
<li>All destruction/disposal of ePHI media will be done in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and pursuant to the Onyx&rsquo;s written retention policy/schedule. Records that have satisfied the period of retention will be destroyed/disposed of in an appropriate manner.</li>
<li>Records involved in any open investigation, audit or litigation should not be destroyed/disposed of. If notification is received that any of the above situations have occurred or there is the potential for such, the record retention schedule shall be suspended for these records until such time as the situation has been resolved. If the records have been requested in the course of a judicial or administrative hearing, a qualified protective order will be obtained to ensure that the records are returned to the organization or properly destroyed/disposed of by the requesting party.</li>
<li>Before reuse of any media, for example, all ePHI is rendered inaccessible, cleaned, or scrubbed. All media is formatted to restrict future access.</li>
<li>All Onyx Subcontractors provide that, upon termination of the contract, they will return or destroy/dispose of all patient health information. In cases where the return or destruction/disposal is not feasible, the contract limits the use and disclosure of the information to the purposes that prevent its return or destruction/disposal.</li>
<li>Any media containing ePHI is disposed using a method that ensures the ePHI could not be readily recovered or reconstructed.</li>
<li>The methods of destruction, disposal, and reuse are reassessed periodically, based on current technology, accepted practices, and availability of timely and cost-effective destruction, disposal, and reuse technologies and services.</li>
<li>In the case of a Onyx Customer terminating a contract with Onyx and no longer utilizing Onyx Services, the following actions will be taken depending on the Onyx Services in use. In all cases it is solely the responsibility of the Onyx Customer to maintain the safeguards required of HIPAA once the data is transmitted out of Onyx Systems.

<ul>
<li>In the case of PaaS Customer termination, Onyx will provide the customer with 30 days from the date of termination to export data.</li>

						<h1 id="23-onyx-hipaa-business-associate-agreement-baa">23. Onyx HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (&ldquo;BAA&rdquo;)</h1>

<p>This HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (this &ldquo;BAA&rdquo;) defines the rights and responsibilities of Provider and Customer with respect to Protected Health Information (&ldquo;PHI&rdquo;) as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, including the HITECH Act and Omnibus Rule, as each may be amended from time to time (collectively, &ldquo;HIPAA&rdquo;). This BAA shall be applicable only in the event and to the extent Provider meets, with respect to Customer, the definition of a Business Associate set forth at 45 C.F.R. ยง160.103, or applicable successor provisions. This BAA shall only be applicable to Customer&rsquo;s Hosting Services or Services to the extent that Customer uses the Hosting Services for Customer&rsquo;s Applications and as specified in the Platform as a Service Agreement of which this Exhibit C is attached and fully referenced and incorporated herein (the &ldquo;PaaS Agreement&rdquo;). This BAA is intended to ensure that Business Associate and Customer will establish and implement appropriate safeguards where Business Associate may receive, create, maintain, use or disclose in connection with the functions, activities and services that Business Associate performs on behalf of Customer solely to perform its duties and responsibilities under the PaaS Agreement.</p>

<ol>
<li>Applicability and Definitions. This BAA applies only where:

<ol>
<li>Service Offerings. Business Associate may use or disclose PHI for or on behalf of Customer as defined in the PaaS Agreement.</li>
<li>Administration and Management of Services. Business Associate may Use and Disclose PHI as necessary for the sole purpose of the proper management and administration of Hosting Services. Any disclosures under this section will be made only if Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the recipient of the PHI that (i) the recipient will hold the PHI confidentially and will use or disclose the PHI only as required by law or for the purpose for which it was disclosed to the recipient, and (ii) the recipient will notify Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Obligations of Business Associate.

<ol>
<li>Limit on Uses and Disclosures. Business Associate will use or disclose PHI only as permitted by this BAA or as required by law, provided that any such use or disclosure would not violate HIPAA if done by a Covered Entity, unless permitted for a Business Associate under HIPAA.</li>
<li>Safeguards. Business Associate will use reasonable and appropriate safeguards to prevent Use or Disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by this BAA, consistent with the requirements of Subpart C of 45 C.F.R. Part 164 (with respect to Electronic PHI) as determined by Business Associate and as reflected in the PaaS Agreement, which includes Disk Encryption and Encryption In-Transit services.</li>
<li>Reporting. For all reporting obligations under this BAA, the parties acknowledge that, because Business Associate does not know the details of PHI contained in any of Customer Applications, there will be no obligation on the Business Associate to provide information about the identities of the Individuals who may have been affected, or a description of the type of information that may have been subject to a Security Incident, Impermissible Use or Disclosure, or Breach. Business Associate will ensure Customer access to Audit Logging to help Customer in addressing Customer&rsquo;s obligations for reporting under this BAA. Customer acknowledges Business Associate is under no obligation to provide additional support for Customer&rsquo;s BAA reporting obligations but may choose to provide such additional services at its sole discretion or at Customer expense.</li>
<li>Reporting of Impermissible Uses and Disclosures. Business Associate will report to Customer any Use or Disclosure of PHI not permitted or required by this BAA of which Business Associate becomes aware.</li>
<li>Reporting of Security Incidents. Business Associate will report to Customer on no less than fourteen business (14) days from the date any Security Incidents involving PHI of which Business Associate becomes aware in which there is a successful unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of information or interference with system operations in an Information System in a manner that risks the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information. Notice is hereby deemed provided, and no further notice will be provided, for unsuccessful attempts at such unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction, such as pings and other broadcast attacks on a firewall, denial of service attacks, port scans, unsuccessful login attempts, or interception of encrypted information where the key is not compromised, or any combination of the above.</li>
<li>Reporting of Breaches. Business Associate will report to Customer any Breach of Customer&rsquo;s Unsecured PHI that Business Associate may discover to the extent required by 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.410. Business Associate will make such report without unreasonable delay, and in no case later than four (4) hours after discovery of such Breach. Business Associate undertakes no obligation to report network security related incidents which occur on its managed network but does not directly involve Customer&rsquo;s use of Hosting Services.</li>
<li>Subcontractors. Business Associate will ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of Business Associate agree to restrictions and conditions at least as stringent as those found in this BAA, and agree to implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protect PHI.</li>
<li>Access to PHI. Customer acknowledges that Business Associate is not required by this BAA to make disclosures of PHI to Individuals or any person other than Customer, and that Business Associate does not, therefore, expect to maintain documentation of such disclosure as described in 45 CFR ยง 164.528. In the event that Business Associate does make such disclosure, it shall document the disclosure as would be required for Customer to respond to a request by an Individual for an accounting of disclosures in accordance with 45 CFR ยง164.504(e)(2)(ii)(G) and ยง164.528, and shall provide such documentation to Customer promptly on Customer&rsquo;s request. In the event that a request for an accounting is made directly to Business Associate shall, within 5 Business Days, forward such request to Customer.</li>
<li>Accounting of Disclosures. Business Associate will make available to Customer the information required to provide an accounting of Disclosures in accordance with 45 C.F.R. ยง 164.528 of which Business Associate is aware, if requested by Customer. Because Business Associate cannot readily identify which Individuals are identified or what types of PHI are included in Customer Content, Customer will be solely responsible for identifying which Individuals, if any, may have been included in Customer Content that Provider has disclosed and for providing a brief description of the PHI disclosed.</li>
<li>Internal Records. Provider will make its internal practices, books, and records relating to the Use and Disclosure of PHI available to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&ldquo;HHS&rdquo;) for purposes of determining Customer compliance with HIPAA. Nothing in this section will waive any applicable privilege or protection, including with respect to trade secrets and confidential commercial information.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Customer&rsquo;s Obligations:

<ol>
<li>Appropriate Use of HIPAA Accounts. Customer is responsible for implementing appropriate privacy and security safeguards in order to protect PHI in compliance with HIPAA and this BAA.

<li>HIPAA Account Appropriate Configurations: Customer is solely responsible for configuring, and will configure, all Customer Applications as follows:</li>
<li>Encryption. Customer shall encrypt all PHI stored or transmitted outside the Services in accordance with the Secretary of HHS&rsquo;s Guidance to Render Unsecured Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals, available at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/breachnotificationrule/brguidance.html, as it may be updated from time to time, and as may be made available on any successor or related site designated by HHS.</li>
<li>TLS Termination: All services must be served via TLS. Customer is responsible for providing, maintaining and updating a valid TLS certificate for use with the Service. TLS certificates must be a minimum of 4096 bit key size. Customer agrees to comply with Business Associate&rsquo;s requirements regarding TLS termination.</li>
<li>Necessary Consents. Customer warrants that it has obtained any necessary authorizations, consents, and other permissions that may be required under applicable law prior to placing Customer Content, including without limitation PHI, on the Services.</li>
<li>Restrictions on Disclosures. Customer shall not agree to any restriction requests or place any restrictions in any notice of privacy practices that would cause Business Associate to violate this BAA or any applicable law.</li>
<li>Compliance with HIPAA. Customer shall not request or cause Business Associate to make a Use or Disclosure of PHI in a manner that does not comply with HIPAA or this BAA.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Term and Termination

<li>Effect of Termination. At termination of this BAA, Business Associate, if feasible, will return or destroy all PHI that Business Associate still maintains, if any. If return or destruction is not feasible, Business Associate will extend the protections of this Agreement to the PHI, limit further uses and disclosures to those purposes that make the return of the PHI infeasible, and make not further use or disclosure of PHI.</li>
<li>If Customer requests contemporaneously with any termination event or notice, Business Associate will allow Customer to have access to Customer&rsquo;s account for a reasonable period of time following termination as necessary for Customer to retrieve or delete any PHI at its then current monthly recurring rate; provided, however, that if the security of Customer&rsquo;s servers has been compromised, or the Agreement was terminated by Customer&rsquo;s failure to use reasonable security precautions, Business Associate may: (i) provide Customer with restricted access via a dedicated or private link or tunnel to Customer account or (ii) refuse to allow Customer to have access to Customer&rsquo;s account but will use reasonable efforts to copy Customer data on to media Customer provides to Business Associate, and will ship the media to Customer at Customer expense. Business Associate&rsquo;s efforts to copy Customer data onto Customer media shall be billable as an Additional Service at Business Associate&rsquo;s then current hourly rates.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>No Agency Relationship. As set forth in the Agreement, nothing in this BAA is intended to make either party an agent of the other. Nothing in this BAA is intended to confer upon Customer the right or authority to control Business Associate&rsquo;s conduct in the course of Business Associate complying with the Agreement and BAA.</li>
<li>Nondisclosure. Customer agrees that the terms of this BAA are not publicly known and constitute Business Associate Confidential Information under the Agreement.</li>
<li>Entire Agreement; Conflict. Except as amended by this BAA, the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

If there is a conflict between the Agreement, this BAA or any other amendment or BAA to the Agreement or this BAA, the document later in time will prevail.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous.

<ol>
<li>Amendment. Customer and Business Associate agrees to take such action as is reasonably necessary to amend this HIPAA BAA from time to time as is necessary for either party to comply with the requirements of the Privacy Rule and related laws and regulations.</li>
<li>Survival. Customer and Business Associate&rsquo;s respective rights and obligations under this HIPAA BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</li>
<li>Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the PaaS Agreement shall be resolved to permit Customer to comply with HIPAA and the Privacy Rule.</li>
