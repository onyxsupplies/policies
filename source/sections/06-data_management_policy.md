# 6. Data Management Policy

Onyx has procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic protected health information (ePHI) stored in conjunction with Onyx Add-ons and for PaaS Customers utilizing our Backup Service. This policy, and associated procedures for testing and restoring from backup data, do not apply to PaaS Customers that do not choose Onyx Backup Service. The policy and procedures will assure that complete, accurate, retrievable, and tested backups are available for all systems used by Onyx.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of Onyx. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, both for Onyx and Onyx Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that data remains available when needed and in case of a disaster.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
