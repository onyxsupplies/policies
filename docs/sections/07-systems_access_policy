<h2 id="7-2-access-establishment-and-modification">7.2 Access Establishment and Modification</h2>

<ol>
<li>Requests for access to Onyx Platform systems and applications are made formally using the following process:

<ol>
<li>A Onyx workforce member initiates the access request by creating an Issue in the Onyx Quality Management System.

<ul>
<li>User identities must be verified prior to granting access to new accounts.</li>
<li>Identity verification must be done in person where possible; for remote employees, identities must be verified over the phone.</li>
<li>For new accounts, the method used to verify the user&rsquo;s identity must be recorded on the Issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Security Officer or Privacy Officer will grant access to systems as dictated by the employee&rsquo;s job title. If additional access is required outside of the minimum necessary to perform job functions, the requester must include a description of why the additional access is required as part of the access request.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required. The Security Officer or Privacy Officer then grants requested access.

<ul>
<li>New accounts will be created with a temporary secure password that meets all requirements from <a href="#7.12-password-management">ยง7.12</a>, which must be changed on the initial login.</li>
<li>All password exchanges must occur over an authenticated channel.</li>
<li>For production systems, access grants are accomplished by adding the appropriate user account to the corresponding LDAP group.</li>
<li>For non-production systems, access grants are accomplished by leveraging the access control mechanisms built into those systems. Account management for non-production systems may be delegated to a Onyx employee at the discretion of the Security Officer or Privacy Officer .</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Access is not granted until receipt, review, and approval by the Onyx Security Officer or Privacy Officer.</li>
<li>The request for access is retained for future reference.</li>
<li>All access to Onyx systems and services is reviewed and updated on a bi-annual basis to ensure proper authorizations are in place commensurate with job functions. The process for conducting reviews is outlined below:

<ol>
<li>The Security Officer initiates the review of user access by creating an Issue in the Onyx Quality Management System.</li>
<li>The Security Officer is assigned to review levels of access for each Onyx workforce member.</li>
<li>If user access is found during review that is not in line with the least privilege principle, the process below is used to modify user access and notify the user of access changes. Once those steps are completed, the Issue is then reviewed again.</li>
<li>Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.</li>
<li>If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.</li>
<li>Review of user access is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Management System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Any Onyx workforce member can request change of access using the process outlined in <a href="#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification">ยง7.2 paragraph 1</a>.</li>
<li>Access to production systems is controlled using centralized user management and authentication.</li>
<li>Temporary accounts are not used unless absolutely necessary for business purposes.

<ul>
<li>Accounts are reviewed every 90 days to ensure temporary accounts are not left unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Accounts that are inactive for over 90 days are removed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the case of non-personal information, such as generic educational content, identification and authentication may not be required. This is the responsibility of Onyx Customers to define, and not Onyx.</li>
<li>Privileged users must first access systems using standard, unique user accounts before switching to privileged users and performing privileged tasks.

<ul>
<li>For production systems, this is enforced by creating non-privileged user accounts that must invoke <code>sudo</code> to perform privileged tasks.</li>
<li>Rights for privileged accounts are granted by the Security Officer or Privacy Officer using the process outlined in <a href="#7.2-access-establishment-and-modification">ยง7.2 paragraph 1</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All application to application communication using service accounts is restricted and not permitted unless absolutely needed. Automated tools are used to limit account access across applications and systems.</li>
<li>Generic accounts are not allowed on Onyx systems.</li>
<li>Access is granted through encrypted, VPN tunnels that utilize two-factor authentication.

<ul>
<li>Two-factor authentication is accomplished using a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) as the second factor.</li>
<li>VPN connections use 256-bit AES 256 encryption, or equivalent.</li>
<li>VPN sessions are automatically disconnected after 30 minutes of inactivity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In cases of increased risk or known attempted unauthorized access, immediate steps are taken by the Security and Privacy Officer to limit access and reduce risk of unauthorized access.</li>
<li>Direct system to system, system to application, and application to application authentication and authorization are limited and controlled to restrict access.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="7-3-workforce-clearance">7.3 Workforce Clearance</h2>

<ol>
<li>The level of security assigned to a user to the organization&rsquo;s information systems is based on the minimum necessary amount of data access required to carry out legitimate job responsibilities assigned to a user&rsquo;s job classification and/or to a user needing access to carry out treatment, payment, or healthcare operations.</li>
<li>All access requests are treated on a &ldquo;least-access principle.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Onyx maintains a minimum necessary approach to access to Customer data. As such, Onyx, including all workforce members, does not readily have access to any ePHI.</li>
